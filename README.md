`gh` is a terminal utility that allows you to use GitHub directly from your terminal.
No more fiddling with the browser to create a new repository or managing teams.

## Installing
Ezpz!
```
$ go install -u github.com/victorgama/gh
```

## Configuring
To use this tool, two environment variables must be set: `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_USERNAME`.

1. Generate a new [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and store it in the `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable
2. Ensure to set another envvar named `GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.
3. Done!


## Usage

> **Notice**: Assume the value of `GITHUB_USERNAME` is `octocat`.

### Creating a repository
```
gh new --private --license mit --gitignore Go my-repo
```

This will create a new private repository, `octocat/my-repo`, initialized with a MIT license file and a `.gitignore`

```
gh new --private --license mit --gitignore Go github/my-repo
```

If a complete repo name is provided, `gh` will attempt to create a new repo under the provided path. When the owner name is absent, `GITHUB_USERNAME` is assumed as its value.

### Deleting a repository
```
gh rm my-repo
```

`gh rm` will ask for confirmation and then will delete a repository under `octocat/my-repo`

```
gh rm github/my-repo
```

`gh rm` follows the same path convention as `gh new`

### Listing repositories
```
gh l | gh ls | gh list
```

This will list all repositories under you account and organizations you have access

### Collaboration management

`gh` allows you to manage your collaborators and teams.

#### Listing
```
gh collab list my-repo
gh collab list octocat/my-repo
```

- For an user repository:
    - Lists all collaborators and their permissions
- For an organization repository:
    - Lists all teams that have access to this repository
    - Lists all outside collaborators for the given repository

#### Adding collaborators and teams
```
gh collab add [repository] [team-slug|contributor-username](:permission-level)
gh collab add github/secret design:write
```
Adds an user or team to an user or org repository.

- For an user repository:
    - Assumes the provided value is an username, searches for it and adds them as a collaborator
    > **Notice**: It is not possible to use a `:permission-level` for user repositories.
- For an organization repository:
    - Assumes the provided value is a team slug. Searches for it and adds it under the given `:permission-level`.
    - If `permission-level` is absent, assumes the team permission level.
    - If the target organization does not have a team with the provided name, searches for users, and adds them under the given `:permission-level`
    - Assumes `push` as the permission, if absent.
Valid values for `permission-level` are `read|pull`, `write|push`, and `admin`

> **Notice**: You can also use this command to update a user or team permission level. âœ¨

> **Protip**: `gh` will ask for confirmation if the operation may cause unintended results.

#### Removing collaborators
```
gh collab rm [repository] [team-slug|contributor-username]
gh collab rm github/secret octocat
```
Removes an user or team from an user or org repository.

- For an user repository:
    - Assumes the provided value is an username, and attempts to remove it from the repository
- For an organization repository:
    - Assumes the provided value is a team slug. Searches for it in the repo's organization and if found, removes it from the repository.
    - If the target organization does not have a team with the provided name, searches for users, and removes them from the repo.

### Team management

#### Listing teams
```
gh teams list [org]
gh teams list github
```
Lists all teams for a given organization. Includes its name, slug, description, privacy and permission options.

#### Listing members
```
gh teams members [org] [team-slug]
gh teams members github design
```
Lists handles for users in a given organization team

#### Adding members to a team
```
gh teams add [username](:role) [org] [team-slug]
gh teams add octocat github design
```
Adds a given `username`, under an optional `role`, into a team under `team-slug` on the `org` organization.

Please note that if `username` is not yet a member of the target organization, an invite will sent to them.
Permitted role values are `member` and `maintainer`.

#### Removing members from a team
```
gh teams rm [username] [org] [team-slug]
gh teams rm octocat github design
```
Removes a given `username` from a team under `team-slug` on the `org` organization.
